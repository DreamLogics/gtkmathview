  The purpose of the project is the development of a suitable technology for the creation
  and maintenance of a virtual, distributed, hypertextual library of structured mathematical
  knowledge, eventaully passing through the eXtensible Markup Language. The final aim
  is to allow mathematical documents to be served, received and processed on the Web, just
  as HTML has enabled this function for the text.
